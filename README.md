Since we need to sort the elements from the dataset then we should use sorting algorithms. For this specific problem, two classification algorithms are used (decision tree classification, naïve bayes classification) and the one with the most accuracy in this particular case, naïve bayes, is chosen because it is a simple and fast algorithm with quite high accuracy.
